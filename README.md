# IntelBin-AIoT-Garbage-Classification

## Project Overview
This is the final project for the Physics for Information Technology course.

**Authors:** Nguyen Van Tu, Luong Gia Thiec

## Repository Contents
- Wokwi diagram
- Source code for ESP32 (Wokwi)
- Node-RED flow
- Custom YOLOv5 model for garbage classification

## Project Features
1. Garbage classification using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model.
2. An intuitive Node-RED webpage to visualize data collected from the IntelBin, including:
   - Amount of garbage in each bin
   - Classification history
   - Bin status
   - Monthly garbage types chart for further data processing
3. A working ESP32 with various inputs.
4. Completed 3D drawing of IntelBin in Fusion360, which can be 3D printed.
5. Achieved a perfect score (10/10) for this subject.
