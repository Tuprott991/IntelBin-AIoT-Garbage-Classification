-- This is the final project of physics for information technology -- 
Authors: Nguyen Van Tu, Luong Gia Thiec



-- This repos include: Wokwi digram, Source code for ESP32 (Wokwi),  Node-red flow, 
		       Custom Yolov5 model for garbage classification
-- In this project we actually create a Intel Bin that have features:
1. Garbage classification using custom trained YOLOv5
2. A intuitive Node-RED webpage for visualize data collect from the IntelBin: Amount of garbage in each Bin, Classification history, Bin status, Monthly garbage types chart for further data process
3. A working ESP32 with different input 
4. Completed 3D drawing of IntelBin in Fusion360, which can be 3d printed later
